# UniversalRomSorter
A script to sort No-Intro and Redump sets into organized folders.

The script exists in two versions, one written in PowerShell and one written in AutoIt. Both scripts are identical in the way they function and have only minor differences. The AutoIt version is used to compile the release .exe file.

```
Usage:    urs.exe [rom directory]
Example:  urs.exe "D:\ROMS\No-Intro\Sega - Mega Drive - Genesis"
```
