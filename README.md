# UniversalRomSorter
A script to sort No-Intro and Redump sets into organized folders.

The script exists in two versions, one written in PowerShell and one written in AutoIt. The AutoIt version is used to compile the release .exe file. Both scripts are identical in the way they function and have only minor differences.
